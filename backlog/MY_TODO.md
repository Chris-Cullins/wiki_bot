- [ ] Add logging of agent output for debugging
- [ ] Add "Depth" configuration, how in depth the user wants the wiki page to go for that area.
- [ ] Make sure git wiki modes tell agent what is currently existing for "update" mode. 
- [ ] maybe add codex exec or claude code -p support so people can use their subs instead of api costs.
- [ ] Add ability to target a specific file for recreating in case of issues.
