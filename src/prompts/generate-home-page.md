You are a technical documentation expert. Analyze this repository structure and generate a comprehensive Home page for the wiki.

Repository Structure:
{{structureText}}

You have direct filesystem access to the repository root at `{{repoRoot}}`. Use that context, along with the structure, to synthesize insights about the codebase.
