You are a software architect analyzing a repository. Based on the structure below, identify and document the architectural patterns and main areas of the application.

Repository Structure:
{{structureText}}

Please create an Architecture.md page that includes:
1. Overall architectural pattern (e.g., MVC, microservices, layered, component-based)
2. Key directories and their purposes
3. Main architectural "slices" or areas (identify 3-7 distinct areas that developers would work in)
4. Component interactions and dependencies
5. Data flow and system boundaries
6. An architecture diagram expressed as a Mermaid flowchart that summarizes the main components and their interactions

For the architectural slices, provide a list in this format:
## Architectural Areas
- **Area Name**: Brief description

Output requirements:
- Return only the completed Markdown for `Architecture.md`.
- Exclude any meta commentary, intermediate steps, or tool usage descriptions.
- Do not ask for permissions or reference reading/writing files.
- Maintain a technical yet accessible tone.
- Use Mermaid code blocks (```mermaid) for diagrams and avoid ASCII art representations.
